**_Requesting and Receiving data from Patient Log
**_

Open the code file patientlog.py in Python Friendly IDE such as Pycharm, VS Code or JetBrain 

Run the file

In the console, it will ask you options -: Choose 2 to retrieve the data

Choose the Patient whose details you want to request through the numbers

Once you choose the number of patient such as Patient #1, you will see what food they had and which date it was.

That is all you need to do to receive the data. 

If you see a FileNotFoundError, that means that this patient's data was not yet logged in.
